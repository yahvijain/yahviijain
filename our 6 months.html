    <h1>I know I've hurt you, and I'm sorry,
        For all the times I wasn't kind.
        I never meant to make you sad,
        Please know you're always on my mind..
        
        I'll learn from this and make things right,
        You're the one I need in my life.
        Please forgive me, i truly care,
        I'll love you always, I'll always be there.</h1>
        <h2>I am so grateful to have you in my life, you are the biggest reason of my smile everyday. I know sometimes I am unable to give you the love that you want for that particular time but darling I miss you every second every minute every hour and every day.. you are the 1st and the last thought of my day.. and I can not express all my feelings in words for you.
            To have h WIFE like you is the biggest blessing by the god for me. You are the most beautiful most adorable and the most lovable person I have ever seen in my life. And today.. the day when I proposed you is very special for me.. I think 30th of july is the best day of my life... as I proposed my life on this day... HAPPY 6TH MONTH ANNIVERSARY MY LOVE..
            6 is just a number.. but I felt the happiest in this 6 months only because of you... I know lots of problems were also there at the starting.. but I am thankful of god as you are with me today.. I still remember that nervousness I had while proposing you but everything happened was happened for a reason.
            Bade baba ke ashirvad se hi tum mile ho mujhe... maine tumhe kundalpur me hi propose kiya tha.. par bade baba ne mujhe ashirvad me goddess jaisi hi ladki dedi. Jo mera itna khayal rakhti h mujhe itna special feel karwati h.. You are my 1st and last love my darling.. and once again happy 6th month anniversary my love.

        <h3>In your eyes, I see the skies,
            A world of wonder, soft and wise.
            Your smile lights up my darkest day,
            And with your love, you guide my way.
            In every moment, pure and true,
            There’s nothing more beautiful than you.<h3\>
        <h4>I wish I could steal every drop of your tears..
